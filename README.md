# Webserverproxy
Socket programming in python is very user friendly as compared to c. The programmer need not worry about minute details regarding sockets. In python, the user has more chance of focusing on the application layer rather than the network layer. In this tutorial we would be developing a simple multithreaded proxy server capable of handling HTTP traffic. It would be mostly based on the basic socket programming ideas. If you are not sure about the basics then I would recommend that you brush them up before going through this tutorial.  In this proxy, we are downloading the image in a website url using image scraper in python.
